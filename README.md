# init.el
My Emacs init.el file, I've just started using Emacs as my main editor. It enables the Dracula color scheme (visit https://draculatheme.com for more information), the vterm extension, done manually, and the code lines to each paragraph. This is more of a way for me to get it whenever I make a new installation of certain *NIX distribution.
